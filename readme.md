##Pyro v0.4

###Controls (supports 360 controller)
- Arrow Keys, WASD - Move player, navigate Menu
- Esc - Pause
- Enter - menu interact

###Special Controls
- F1 - toggle time based movement vs key based movement.
- F2 - Restart game
- 1 - Shorten trail length
- 2 - Extend trail length


###New Features & Changes
- Added keys to shorten and extend tail if in developer mode.

###Build Notes
To build with fresh solution, you will need to manually link the FreshGameLibrary.dll included in the bin folder. YOu will also need the XNA SDK installed.

###Note
This was made for fun, not necessarily maintainability or long term reliability. Not clean code at all. I'm sure there is lots of remaining code from past projects and ideas from hacky conversion.
