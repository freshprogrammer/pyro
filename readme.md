## Pyro v0.8
##  By Fresh

### How To Play
Navigate your player to gather as much fuel as possible while avoiding the trail of fire left behind you.

### New Features & Changes
- Added fire fade animation after game over. Automatically runs during AI loop.
- Changed game over logic to wait for Esc key press.

### Controls (supports 360 controller)
- Arrow Keys, WASD - Move player, navigate Menu
- Esc - Pause, return to main menu
- Enter - menu interact

### Special Controls (Dev build only)
- F1 - Toggle time based movement vs key based movement.
- F2 - Restart game
- 1 - Shorten trail length
- 2 - Extend trail length

### Build Notes
To build with fresh solution, you will need to manually link the FreshGameLibrary.dll included in the bin folder. You will also need the XNA SDK installed.

### Note
This was made for fun, not necessarily maintainability or long term reliability. Not clean code at all. I'm sure there is lots of remaining code from past projects and ideas from hacky conversion.
