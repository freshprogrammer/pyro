##Pyro v0.1

###Controls (supports 360 controller)
- Arrow Keys, WASD - Move player, navigate Menu
- Esc - Pause
- Enter - menu interact


###New Features
- Input based movement 
- Wrapping around simple empty tiled level. 
- Included quick implementation of fire. Fire is still buggy.

###Build Notes
To build with fresh solution, you will need to manually link the FreshGameLibrary.dll included in the bin folder.

###Note
This was made for fun, not necessarily maintainability or long term reliability. Not clean code at all. I'm sure there is lots of remaining code from past projects and ideas from hacky conversion.
