###Build Notes
To build with fresh solution, you will need to manually link the FreshGameLibrary.dll included in the bin folder. YOu will also need the XNA SDK installed.

###Note
This was made for fun, not necessarily maintainability or long term reliability. Not clean code at all. I'm sure there is lots of remaining code from past projects and ideas from hacky conversion.
