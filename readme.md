### Note
This was made for fun for the One Game a Month 08/2014 and was not intended to be a big completed project. Code was never cleaned at all and I used some of my past code that it probably super messy. I'm sure there is lots of engine code from past projects that is perfect for this but the hacky-ness is kinda the spirit of 1GAM.
