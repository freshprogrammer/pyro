## Pyro v1.0
##  By Fresh

### How To Play
Navigate your player to gather as much fuel as possible while avoiding the trail of fire left behind you.

### Controls (supports 360 controller)
- Arrow Keys, WASD - Move player, navigate Menu
- Esc - Pause, return to main menu
- Enter - menu interact

### Note
This was made for fun, not necessarily maintainability or long term reliability. Not clean code at all. I'm sure there is lots of remaining code from past projects and ideas from hacky conversion.
